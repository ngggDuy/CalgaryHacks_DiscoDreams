- Code name friendship meter: measures how isolated you are feeling. The more isolated you are, the lower the meter gets. Once your meter drops below a certain value, an alert is sent to all people on your friends list so they can come check on you.


FUNCTIONALITY:
- Starting survey to determine starting point of meter. Button to manually adjust meter.
- After meter falls below certain level, alert is sent to all people on user's friend's list
- Log in/account functionality, sidebar to see your friends
- API to display memes depending on the user's mood?
- !!! Eventually: Incorporate AI to evaluate isolation levels based on survey results and Question/Answer..? AI detects anomaly in usage patterns as well.

UI:
- Discord 


URGENT TODOS:
- Front end: 
  - Page layout
  - Get the bar + buttons to manually change working

- Back end: 
  - Set up classes to calculate meter metrics to pass to the front end.
  - Look into firebase to implement log in functionaltiy
